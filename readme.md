# Bra Fitting Recommendation System - Technical Assessment

Introduction
This is a simplified version of a bra fitting recommendation system that helps women find their perfect fit. The system uses RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) principles to match user measurements and issues with the most relevant recommendations.

# Time Expectation
Expected completion time: 2-4 hours
Please don't spend more than 4 hours on this task

# Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
Node.js 14+
npm/yarn
Backend Setup
BASH

# Create and activate virtual environment
```python -m venv venv```

# Windows
```.\venv\Scripts\activate```

# Mac/Linux
```source venv/bin/activate```

# Install dependencies
```
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Run backend
```
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
Frontend Setup
BASH
```

# In the frontend directory
```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

The application will be running at:
```
Frontend: http://localhost:3000
Backend: http://localhost:8000
```

Tasks to Complete
1. Backend Issues
Location: backend/app/recommender.py

Current issues:

Simplistic similarity calculation in calculate_fit_similarity
Basic measurement extraction logic
Generic error handling
Missing input validation
Hardcoded default recommendations
Required improvements:

Implement better similarity matching for measurements and fit issues
Add proper measurement extraction and validation
Add specific error handling
Implement sister size recommendations
2. Frontend Issues
Location: frontend/src/components/ChatInterface.js

# Current issues:

- Missing loading states
- Basic error handling
- Simple recommendation display
- No input validation
- Required improvements:

- Add loading indicators
- Enhance recommendation display
- Add measurement input validation
- Testing Your Changes

# Example Queries
```
"I measure 34 underbust and 38 bust, straps keep falling off"
"My band rides up and I'm measuring 32 under, 37 over"
"36 underbust, 42 bust, getting quadraboob effect"
```
